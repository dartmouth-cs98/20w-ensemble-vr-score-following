# Training Model
* While taking a deeper look into the details of the HSMM algorithm provided by Nakamura, et. al. (2015), we found that
some parameters such as inner-outer-onset time were not easily measured using empirical tools. To simplify the model, we
may integrate parts of Rao's (2018) findings which does not use a specific measure for onset time probability. The model
described instead uses a forward HMM model to train on a given data set and a decoding algorithm to follow a real-time
performance. This involves calculations of four normal/ghost state pair probabilities, each derived recursively. This
may be significantly different from the HSMM proposed by Nakamura et al. Another consideration would be to deviate from
HMM approach and implement a reinforcement learning model for score following. Henkel et al. provide a strong base of
code we may adapt to purposes of automatic accompaniment. Having observed a demo of the work provided by Henkel et al.,
we may pivot to their implementation as the HSMM and HMM approaches have proven overly abstract.
* We have decided to implement a hybrid of the Nakamura and Rao models. The pitch probability calculations are derived
from Nakamura's design while onset timing considerations are implemented using Rao's methodology. This yields a simpler
version of the HSMM described in Nakamura et al., one that does not consider ornamental and repeating events such as
trills.
* We are prioritizing pitch detection implementation before continuing work on score-following. If our final product
cannot detect polyphonic audio in real-time, there might as well not be a score-following element since not everyone
owns a MIDI instrument. We look to X. Li (2018) for guidance in developing a reliable neural network approach to this
problem. We will be using an approacch involving convolutional NN using audio spectrograms as input. This follows from
work done by Carl Thom√©.

* After experimenting with the results of Henkel et al. we have decided that it would not be effective to, for this project, approach the problem of score following using reinforcement learning. Granted, the techniques described in the paper do have many benefits. For example, there is no need for any sort of computer-readable input such as MIDI. Additionally, the model is trained end to end, which eliminates a lot of the preprocessing work that is required in other studies. However, these benefits do not outweight the insurmountable hurdle that the results are not accurate enough to be used practically in any sort of customer-facing application. Even though the research in Henkel et al is very promising, given the time frame of our project, pursuing further research on the topic does not seem like a viable option.

* We have decided to take Nakamura's previous hierarchical HMM. We will integrate Rao's tempo estimation in place of Nakamura's in order to simplify the model and reduce computational complexity. We will use a wire to directly link the Oculus Quest to a computer in order to send messages from the python app to the Unity project. This will take the load off the headset and allow for a stronger connection relative to a Flask implementation. We expect this to be a Term 2 function. We spent Term 1 deciding upon and understanding potential implementations of score-following. We plan to spend the remainder of Term 1 building the scaffolding for the implementation. At Technigala, we will play a fixed recording as accompaniment without taking real-time audio input from the player.
